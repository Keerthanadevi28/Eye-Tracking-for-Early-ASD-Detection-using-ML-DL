# Eye-Tracking-for-Early-ASD-Detection-using-ML-DL

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that can greatly benefit from early detection and intervention. Eye tracking technology has emerged as a promising tool for identifying potential markers of ASD due to its ability to capture subtle differences in gaze patterns and fixations. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyze eye tracking data for the early diagnosis of ASD. By extracting relevant features from eye movement patterns and using advanced classification techniques, we aim to develop a robust and accurate diagnostic tool. The proposed method holds the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ASD screening processes, leading to earlier intervention and better outcomes for individuals on the autism spectrum.
