# Eye-Tracking-for-Early-ASD-Detection-using-ML-DL

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that can greatly benefit from early detection and intervention. Eye tracking technology has emerged as a promising tool for identifying potential markers of ASD due to its ability to capture subtle differences in gaze patterns and fixations. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyze eye tracking data for the early diagnosis of ASD. By extracting relevant features from eye movement patterns and using advanced classification techniques, we aim to develop a robust and accurate diagnostic tool. The proposed method holds the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ASD screening processes, leading to earlier intervention and better outcomes for individuals on the autism spectrum.

The key findings and insights regarding the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using eye-tracking data are as follows:

Utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms:

Preprocessing Eye Tracking Data: Before employing machine learning algorithms, it is essential to preprocess the eye tracking data, involving tasks such as data cleansing, normalization, and feature engineering.
Supervised Learning Approach: In a supervised learning framework, eye tracking data is categorized with labels distinguishing between ASD and neurotypical individuals. Algorithms such as Support Vector Machines can be employed for classifying individuals based on their gaze patterns.
Performance Evaluation Metrics: The effectiveness of the machine learning model in diagnosing and detecting ASD is assessed using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve.
Utilizing Deep Learning Techniques:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are widely employed for tasks related to image analysis, including the examination of eye tracking data. They possess the capability to autonomously discern pertinent features from raw eye-tracking images, proving advantageous in identifying subtle gaze patterns linked to ASD.
Transfer Learning: Employing pre-trained deep learning models, such as pre-trained CNNs, offers the opportunity to fine-tune them for the specific objective of ASD detection utilizing eye tracking data. This approach capitalizes on knowledge acquired from extensive datasets, making it particularly valuable when dealing with limited eye tracking data.
Data Augmentation: Introducing variations into the eye tracking data through data augmentation serves as a valuable strategy to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model, contributing to its ability to adapt and perform effectively across diverse scenarios.
Model Performance:

The ResNet-50 model emerged as the most effective, achieving a test accuracy of 85%, surpassing alternative techniques. This underscores the significance of transfer learning and data augmentation in optimizing CNN performance for medical datasets, offering valuable insights for ongoing discussions in the field.
In summary, the findings highlight the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models, particularly CNNs, in accurately diagnosing ASD using eye-tracking data. The utilization of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques significantly enhances the performance of the models, particularly the ResNet-50 model, in accurately categorizing individuals with ASD. These insights offer valuable contributions to the field of ASD diagnosis and emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning and deep learning approaches for preemptive identification of ASD.
